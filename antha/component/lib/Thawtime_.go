	Let's first work out the heat energy transferred via convection, this uses an empirical parameter,
	the convective heat transfer coefficient of air (HC_air), this is calculated via another function in the eng library.
	In future we will make this process slightly more sophisticated by adding conditions, since this empirical equation is
	only validated between air velocities 2 - 20 m/s. It could also be adjusted to calculate heat transfer if the sample
	is agitated on a shaker to speed up thawing. */

	imprecision in the estimates and 	empirical formaulas) we'll multiply by a fudgefactor to be safer that we've definitely thawed,
